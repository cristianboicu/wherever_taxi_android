# Wherever Taxi Android App

Wherever Taxi is a prototype of an online ride hailing application for Android.

**Project Description**

As part of the development of the diploma project, an application for accessing taxi services and a driver simulator were developed for a more accurate modeling of the process of requesting taxi services that already exist in the real world. Wherever Taxi is a minimum viable product that combines both the functionality needed to access taxi services and a simple, pleasant and intuitive graphical interface.

Although at the current stage the project is not ready for commercialization and cannot yet be delivered to users, it is a qualitative software product that can eventually be scaled to expand the functionality and use it at scale wide.

The client application meets the following functional requirements:

<ul>• User login via phone number</ul>
<ul>• User logout</ul>
<ul>• Customizing the customer account</ul>
<ul>• Selecting the starting point and destination and placing the travel request</ul>
<ul>• Selecting the desired car type, standard or comfort</ul>
<ul>• Selecting the payment method</ul>
<ul>• Cancellation of the travel request</ul>
<ul>• Monitoring the progress of the trip in real time</ul>
<ul>• Evaluation of the driver at the end of the trip</ul>
<ul>• Access to travel history</ul>
